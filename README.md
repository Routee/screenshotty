# Screenshotty

The library combines [MediaProjection](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/projection/MediaProjection), [PixelCopy](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/PixelCopy) and Canvas drawing and provides an easy-to-use API, abstracted from the Android framework and the complexities of the underlying mechanisms, to capture precisely what a user sees on their screen.

[The sample app](https://github.com/bolteu/screenshotty/blob/master/sample/src/main/java/eu/bolt/screenshotty/sample/MainActivity.kt) shows how to use the library.

## Gradle
Add this to your dependencies block.
```
implementation 'eu.bolt:screenshotty:1.0.4'
```

To use a [reactive wrapper](https://github.com/bolteu/screenshotty/new/master?readme=1#reactive-wrapper) also add:
```
implementation 'eu.bolt:screenshotty-rx:1.0.4'
```

To work with [coroutines](https://github.com/bolteu/screenshotty/new/master?readme=1#coroutines) add: 
```
implementation 'eu.bolt:screenshotty-coroutines:1.0.4'
```

## Wiki

### General
If we want to capture a screenshot inside the app, the simplest approach is to draw the root view on a `Bitmap`, but
this approach won't work correctly if there are open dialogs, or view hierarchy contains maps or other `SurfaceView`s.
Screenshotty uses [PixelCopy](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/PixelCopy) and [MediaProjection](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/projection/MediaProjection) to
provide the correct image in all these cases.

First the library tries to make a `PixelCopy` with dialogs, retrieved via reflection, rendered on top.

If this approach fails, user will see a record screen permission dialog. Screenshotty minimizes the number of times the dialog is shown: permission has to be granted only once per process lifetime. If "Don't show again" option (removed in Android 10) is checked, the system will remember user's choice for all the future invocations. If the permission is granted, a `MediaProjection` API is used to take a single frame and provide it to result listeners.

In case `MediaProjection` fails, fallback strategies are invoked one-by-one until the first one succeeds to provide a Bitmap.

### Usage

1. Create a `ScreenshotManager`:

```kotlin
screenshotManager = ScreenshotManagerBuilder(this)
   .withCustomActionOrder(ScreenshotActionOrder.pixelCopyFirst()) //optional, ScreenshotActionOrder.pixelCopyFirst() by default
   .withPermissionRequestCode(REQUEST_SCREENSHOT_PERMISSION) //optional, 888 by default
   .build()
```

2. Make sure the object receives activity results:

```kotlin
override fun onActivityResult(requestCode: Int, resultCode: Int, data: Intent?) {
   super.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data)
   screenshotManager.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data)
}
```
3. Request a screenshot and observe the result:

```kotlin
val screenshotResult = screenshotManager.makeScreenshot()
val subscription = screenshotResult.observe(
   onSuccess = { processScreenshot(it) },
   onError = { onMakeScreenshotFailed(it) }
)
```
4. If you're no longer interested in the result (as when your `Activity` is destroyed), you can unsubscribe your observers using the object you got from `observe()`.

```kotlin
override fun onDestroy() {
   super.onDestroy()
   subscription.dispose()
}
```

### Working with result

When you receive a `Screenshot` you can either get a `Bitmap` object from it:
```kotlin
fun show(screenshot: Screenshot) {
   val bitmap = when (screenshot) {
      is ScreenshotBitmap -> screenshot.bitmap
   }
   screenshotPreview.setImageBitmap(bitmap)
}
```
Or use `ScreenshotFileSaver` provided by the library to write the image to a file:
```kotlin
fun writeToFile(screenshot: Screenshot): File {
   val fileSaver = ScreenshotFileSaver.create(Bitmap.CompressFormat.PNG)
   val targetFile = File(context.filesDir, "screenshot")
   fileSaver.saveToFile(targetFile, screenshot)
   return targetFile
}
```

### Reactive wrapper

If you're using [screenshotty-rx](https://github.com/bolteu/screenshotty/new/master?readme=1#gradle), you can transform your `ScreenshotManager` object into `RxScreenshotManager`:
```kotlin
val rxScreenshotManager = screenshotManager.asRxScreenshotManager() //or RxScreenshotWrapper.wrap(screenshotManager)
```
[Usage](https://github.com/bolteu/screenshotty/new/master?readme=1#usage) is exactly the same, but `makeScreenshot()` returns `Single<Screenshot>` instead of `ScreenshotResult`, so you can use all the expressive power of reactive composition to process the result:
```kotlin
subscription = rxScreenshotManager.makeScreenshot()
   .observeOn(Schedulers.io())
   .map(::writeToFile)
   .doOnSuccess(::sendScreenshotFile)
   .observeOn(AndroidSchedulers.mainThread())
   .subscribe(
      onSuccess = ::onScreenshotSent,
      onError = ::handleError
   )
```

### Coroutines wrapper
Screenshooty also supports [coroutines](https://github.com/bolteu/screenshotty/new/master?readme=1#gradle) by exposing the `ScreenshotManager.makeScreenshotAsync()` suspend extension function.
```kotlin
    screenshotManager.makeScreenshotAsync()
``` 
[Usage](https://github.com/bolteu/screenshotty/new/master?readme=1#usage) is exactly the same, but `makeScreenshot()` is a `suspend` function.

### Fallback strategies

When constructing a `ScreenshotManager` you can add any number of objects that implement [`FallbackStrategy`](https://github.com/bolteu/screenshotty/blob/master/screenshotty-lib/src/main/java/eu/bolt/screenshotty/FallbackStrategy.kt) interface. If `PixelCopy` or `MediaProjection` fails for some reason, fallback strategies will be invoked
one by one in the order they were added, until the first one succeeds to provide a `Bitmap`.

If no strategies were added or all of them failed, the default one (that simply calls `draw` on the root view and tries to render dialogs retrieved via reflection on top) will be invoked.

### Actions order

When constructing a `ScreenshotManager` an order in which screenshot actions will be taken can be specified. By default the order is `PixelCopy` -> `MediaProjection` -> `Fallbacks`, but that can be easily changed.  
Note that `Fallbacks` will still run in the order they were added in. `ScreenshotActionOrder` provides all possible actions and convenient order creators.
